# gisland

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gisland is to wrap some often used spatial related scripts into convenient functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gisland from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("einarhjorleifsson/gisland")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(gisland)
```


Get some object from LM√ç geoserver:

```{r}
iceland <- read_strandlinur()
glines <- read_grunnlinur()
miles12 <- read_12miles()
```

What do we have?:

```{r  fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = iceland) +
  geom_sf(data = glines, colour = "red") +
  geom_sf(data = miles12, colour = "blue")
```

Could also do:

```{r}
library(mapview)
mapview(glines) + miles12
```
